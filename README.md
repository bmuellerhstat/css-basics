# CSS Basics
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using basic CSS(Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.) properties._

## Before you begin
Observe the files in this repo:  

* `font-practice.png` is something you'll need later; you can ignore it for now.
* `index.html` is the directions that will guide you through the activity.  Do not change it at all.
* `README.md` is the file you're reading.  You should be reading it on GitHub.
* `result.png` is the result you should be aiming for with `index.html` once it has `style.css` applied.
* `style.css` is where you will be doing your coding that will make `index.html` look pretty.

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repo.
* Follow all of the directions in `index.html`.  
  * You only need the preview; you shouldn't need the raw code.
  * Note: the preview looks better in the pop-out window of **cloud9**.
* When you are finished, the preview should look like `result.png`.
* Beautify your code.  
  * _NOTE: the cloud9 keyboard shortcut is_ `âŒ˜+shift+B`

## Done and Done

Make sure you `add`/`commit`/`push` and change your repo's settings to use the `master` branch for **gh-pages**.  Make sure you test the URL!
