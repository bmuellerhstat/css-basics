# CSS Basics
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using basic CSS properties._

## Before you begin
Observe the files in this repo:  

* `font-practice.png` is something you'll need later; you can ignore it for now.
* `index.html` is the directions that will guide you through the activity.  Do not change it at all.
* `README.md` is the file you're reading.  You should be reading it on GitHub.
* `result.png` is the result you should be aiming for with `index.html` once it has `style.css` applied.
* `style.css` is where you will be doing your coding that will make `index.html` look pretty.

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repo.
* Follow all of the directions in `index.html`.  
  * You only need the preview; you shouldn't need the raw code.
  * Note: the preview looks better in the pop-out window of **cloud9**.
* When you are finished, the preview should look like `result.png`.
* Beautify your code.  
  * _NOTE: the cloud9 keyboard shortcut is_ `⌘+shift+B`
* Mirror your `master` branch with a `gh-pages` branch and `push`.

Good luck!
